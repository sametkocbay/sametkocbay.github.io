I am a graduate student in Computational Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. My main motivation is the application of scientific computing to problems in engineering and the physical sciences. Currently, I am pursuing my interest in **fusion research**, where numerical simulation and high-performance computing play a central role in advancing sustainable energy technologies.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of **numerical methods, high-performance computing, and machine learning**. In particular, I am interested in developing machine learning-based approaches for scientific computing, including surrogate modeling, physics-informed learning, and data-driven acceleration of simulation pipelines.  

Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I focused on computational methods in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.
