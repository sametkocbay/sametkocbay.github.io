## Education
- **M.Sc. Computational Science and Engineering**, Technical University of Munich (since October 2024)
- **B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering**, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (October 2019 – September 2024)

## Academic Experience
**Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, IPP** (October 2025 – Currently) – *Student Researcher*
- Developing a no-wall boundary condition for the non-linear MHD code JOREK.

**Institute of Fluid Mechanics, KIT** (July 2023 – December 2023) – *Student Assistant*
- Developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN) in Python to model flow through an orifice, evaluating its potential as a surrogate model to optimize orifice geometry for desired flow conditions, with the ultimate goal of improving artificial heart valve design.

## Industrial Experience
**BMW** (October 2024 - September 2025) – *Working Student*
- Developed a Gaussian process surrogate model to approximate expensive NVH simulations, with a focus on extending its applicability to vibroacoustics data in order to enable efficient prediction, design-space exploration, and parameter optimization.

**Compact Dynamics** (March 2024 – September 2024) – *Bachelor Thesis*
- Refined and optimized an RNN architecture to predict rotor temperatures in electric motors.
- Generated data via a back-to-back test bench and integrated the optimized model into the control unit.

**MAN Energy Solutions** (November 2023 – March 2024) – *Internship*
- Modeled secondary airflow in a gas turbine to evaluate performance characteristics.
- Performed coupled 1D CFD simulations using Flownex and 2D thermomechanical analyses in Ansys to assess flow-structure interactions.

## Projects
**KA RaceIng: Aerodynamics** (Oct 2021 – Sept 2022)
- Designed and refined front wing geometry balancing downforce and drag.

**KA RaceIng: Monocoque & FEM** (Oct 2021 – Sept 2022)
- Developed finite element models (FEM) of a Formula Student carbon monocoque to evaluate structural performance.
- Optimized chassis weight through iterative, multi-stage design and analysis processes.

## Leadership
**Formula Student: Head of Aerodynamics** (Sept 2022 – Oct 2023), *KA RaceIng*
- Led a team of 13 engineers, overseeing aerodynamic design, lightweight structures, and CFD analysis to maximize vehicle performance.
